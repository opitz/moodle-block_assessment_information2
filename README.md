Redirect Landingpage Block
=====================

This is a companion to the Landingpage block and requires it to be installed.

When it is installed to the home page of Moodle/QMplus and the user is logged in
and not in edit mode s/he will automatically be redirected to her or his landing page.

This will preserve the landing page functionality without the need of changing any theme code.
